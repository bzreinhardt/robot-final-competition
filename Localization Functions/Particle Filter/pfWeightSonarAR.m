function [w] = pfWeightSonarAR(X,z,h,Q)
% : Find the weight of a state particle by comparing the sensor
% measurements expected from that particle with actual measurements
% 
%   [w] = pfWeightSonar(X,z,h,Q) takes a particle state, finds the expected
%   measurements at that state, evaluates the gaussian pdf with a mean of
%   the expected measurement and the measurement covariance at that point 
%   and uses that value as the point's weight.
% 
%   INPUTS
%       X -  particle state 3x1
%       h  - expected measurement function handle - takes the state as an
%           argument
%       z  - actual measurement 1xK or Kx1 where k is the number of sensors
%       Q - measurement covariance matrix KxK
%       
%       
% 
%   OUTPUTS
%       w   weight of the state - a number between 0,1

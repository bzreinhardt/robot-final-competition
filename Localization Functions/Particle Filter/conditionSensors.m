%CONDITIONSENSORS eliminates bad/useless sensor data and composes 
% the camera and sonar data into one set of useful measurements 
 % INPUTS
% sonarData - data from the sonar sensors [1x3]
% cameraData - data from the AR sensors [Nx5] - 
%   N is the number of seen beacons (can be zero)

%OUTPUTS
% % measurements - row vector of useful measurements - 
% %     1 distance measurement for each valid sonar and 2 for each camera [1xM] 
% % sonars - row vector of sonars that provided valid measurements [1xS] sonars
% %     are numbered from 1 to 3 going counterclockwise from the one located at 
% %     -pi/2 - R = 1, F = 2, L = 3. order corresponds to the range data in measurements.
% % ARs - row vector of tag numbers for the seen AR tags, order corresponds to 
% %     order of AR data in measurments

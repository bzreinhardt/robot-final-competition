%%
%hBeacon finds the expected beacon data for a series of robot poses based
%on a list of beacons

% ASSUMPTIONS 
% Assume that this function will only be used for positive identification
% Assume the robot can only see one beacon at a time
% 
% INPUTS
% pose - robot pose 3x1 or 1x3
% beaconNums - tag #'s of beacons in question
% 
% OUTPUTS
% exp

%% constants 
camViewAngle = 2*pi/3; %view angle on a single side of the camera
camViewDist = 2; %maximum distance the camera can see in meters

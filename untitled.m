function [relocParts] = beaconRelocalize(G_beacon,C_beacon,M,mapLims,cameraR)
% sets up particles based on a seen beacon
%
% G_beacon - location of the beacon in global coordinates
% C_ beacon - location of the bacon in camera coordinates
% M - number of particles
% mapLims - [minX, minY, maxX maxY]
% Camera R, location of the camera along the X coordinate of the robot

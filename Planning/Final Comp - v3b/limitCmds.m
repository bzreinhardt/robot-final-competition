% 
%   [CMDV,CMDW] = LIMITCMDS(FWDVEL,ANGVEL,MAXV,ROBOTRAD) returns the 
%   forward and angular velocity commands to drive a differential-drive 
%   robot whose wheel motors saturate at +/- maxV.
% 
%   INPUTS
%       fwdVel      desired forward velocity (m/s)
%       angVel      desired angular velocity (rad/s)
%       maxV        maximum motor velocity (assumes symmetric saturation)
%       robotRad    robot radius (in meters)
% 
%   OUTPUTS
%       cmdV        scaled forward velocity command (m/s)
%       cmdW        scaled angular velocity command (rad/s)

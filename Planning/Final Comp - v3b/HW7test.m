function HW7test(WorkspaceFileName,BoundaryTopRightCorner,n_PRM,q_start,q_goal,radius)
% Test function for HW 9
%
% Inputs:  WorkspaceFileName = file name for text file representing the obstacles in the workspace
%          BoundaryTopRightCorner = 2x1 vector capturing the [x y] coordinates of the top right 
%                                   corner of the workspace. Assume the bottom left corner is [0 0]
%          n_PRM   = number of nodes in the PRM
%          q_start = 2x1 vector of start point 
%          q_goal  = 2x1 vector of goal point 
%          radius  = robot radius in m

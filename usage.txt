Usage:

% type:
global isLab;
islab = 1;

% this initializes a global varialble called isLab that lets a number of functions know to execute as if they were in the lab rather than the simulator

make sure that the .mat file with the map information is on the path and set the variable mapFile
mapFile = *string of the map information file name*

please add entire folder to the path

call masterPlan(CreatePort,SonarPort,BeaconPort,tagNum,maxTime,mapFile)

it will store all data in the global struct dataStore

At the end, to plot everything in figure 11 call

finalMap(dataStore, mapFile) where dataStore and mapFile are the variables you already declared.
